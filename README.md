# RockPaperScissor
Rock paper scissor game in JavaScript

This is a simple game of rock paper scissor. Currently the computer will just randomly pick between the 3 however, in the future I would like to add some Machine Learning stuff to get the computer to try and learn my pattern and improve the computer success rate. 

Will also make adjustments later on for the animations of the pictures but currently it will just be as simple as possible.
